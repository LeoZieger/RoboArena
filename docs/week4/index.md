what we did this week:

Created a MapCreator for creating map files
- You can switch between different tiles with the number keys 1-6 (for now)
- You can increase and decrease the size (number of Tiles) you are placing with the up-/ down-arrow.
- By pressing "S" you can save the map and choose a name for it
- The map is stored in a .json file

- For now the MapCreator is a different programm than our main-programm (RoboArena.py) but we want implement it
  in the main menu.


Created a Player-Movement-Function
- You can now controll a BasicRobot
- There are 8 possible directions right now


Added Roadmap for better planing
